# Achiv mizik scraper

### This is a cli app project to display music from ACHIV MIZIK (A popular Haitian music library platform ). In this app,  you can display 10 latest music or search for music directly from your cli to achivmizik.net. I use Ruby and Nokogiri to scrap music and store them into a temporary array. You can see info about single music after you list all the music. You can see the music link if you want to go to the music page.
